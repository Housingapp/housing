Non-Emergency

Non-emergency repair requests and extermination concerns can be sent via the online work order form located on the Housing Services website at offices.depaul.edu/housing in the Quicklinks menu on the top right side. Housing Services receives the form and assigns personnel or vendors to perform the service as needed and as warranted. To expedite service, please be as detailed as possible when completing the request form and send no more than one work order or repair request per form. Please specify the location of the problem (e.g., the light switch in the bathroom). Work orders are only processed during business hours, Monday through Friday, when the university is open. 

Please refer to the Guide to Student Housing to learn more about work orders or visit go.depaul.edu/workorders to input one.

Emergency

If students need to report a facilities emergency during the weekend or non-business hours, they should notify the front desk of their building or call Public Safety at (773) 325-7777.

Staff hotline for all urgent / emergency work order requests during major move in days: 5-4684 (staff only).


FURNITURE

All university issued furniture (desks, beds, bookshelves, etc.) must remain in the residence hall room in which it was originally placed. Housing Services does not store furniture for residents or offer any additional storage options. Students may be sent through the conduct process for removing furniture.

BED ADJUSTMENTS
 
In many halls (Corcoran, Courtside, Munroe, Seton, Sanctuary and University Hall), the height of a bed can be adjusted. Please only adjust beds if you have the help of another person; while the process is not difficult, it is not a one-person job. If in trying to adjust any furniture it ends up damaged, please submit a work order. Please refer to the Guide to Student Housing for information on how to submit a work order, then visit go.depaul.edu/workorders.

NOTE: If furniture is damaged by the residents, the amount for repair or replacement is the responsibility of the resident.

LOFTS & BED ENDS
 
For residents who rented lofts through Bedloft, instructions for assembly should be attached to every loft kit, along with a bag of needed parts. If any of this is missing or parts are damaged, residents should contact RHC. Residents may place a work order for Crew assistance assembling rental lofts if necessary, but these requests will take several business days to fulfill.

Residents may request that we remove and store their original bed ends during the year. To request this, residents should submit a work order on/after Sept. 8 (these requests will not be accepted prior). Bed ends must remain in the room until they are picked up. Pickups will begin Sept. 21 and will take up to 3 weeks.


RENTALS OF LOFTS & FRIDGES

Questions, comments or concerns about rental bed lofts, mini-fridges and futons should be directed to the DePaul University Residence Hall Council at:
(773) 325-4742   OR   depaulrhc@gmail.com
During move-in days, members of the RHC executive board will be on hand to assist with any concerns regarding a student’s order (e.g., a student says a loft, fridge or futon was ordered but it is not in the room, or a student has a piece of rental equipment in the room that was not ordered). If these types of issues arise, a student should be instructed to contact RHC via the above phone number or email. RHC officers will be checking voicemail and email throughout the day on all major move-in days and will get back to students promptly with a resolution. Students can also be directed to the vendor website, bedloft.com. If students cannot connect with RHC by phone after repeated tries, they can call the main Housing Services number to be connected with the RHC rep on campus (as staff could locate that person via radio).
