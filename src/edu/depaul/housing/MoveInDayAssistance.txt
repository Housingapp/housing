MOVING ASSISTANCE

Moving assistance will only be available on August 27 and September 2. B French and DePaul Grounds Crew will be available with bins to assist during move-in.

Doorstep Demons will assist families in moving light and/or small items. Upon arrival, the student or family member should take a number from the designated clipboard-holder and wait to be called. Assistance is provided first-come, first-serve. Doorstep Demons will be able to provide some lighter, one-on-one help on August 23 and August 29 as well.


BOXES & GARBAGE

All moving/product boxes should be broken down and taken along with garbage to the designated garbage rooms on each floor in each hall or to the garbage dumpsters outside of the residence halls. It is preferred they take large boxes and trash items directly to the dumpsters.


WRISTBANDS FOR PARKING AND GUESTS

Parking will be 100% confirmed after 8/9
Bright red wristbands are provided at check-in stations. Residents will receive a wristband for each person helping them move (including themselves). The wristbands must be worn by everyone in the moving party. The wristbands serve as temporary identifiers for parents / helpers at the front entrance of the halls for ease of move-in. Front Desk staff will recognize the wristband and allow the person wearing it to come and go during move-in hours (9 a.m. until ~9 p.m.). After 9 p.m., wristbands will no longer be valid for entry and all residents must show their ID cards to enter and all guests must have a valid state or DePaul ID to enter the hall. 

PARKING

For selected move-in dates (August 23, August 27, August 29 and September 2), these wristbands also serve as a voucher for free parking in garages on the DePaul Lincoln Park Campus. Wristbands must be shown to the parking attendant when exiting parking structures. 

Please note (does not apply to spaces in front of Sheffield Square):  If parents/residents choose to park in a city “Pay to Park (street parking)” space, they are responsible for the cost of the parking. DePaul Housing has purchased some street parking for loading zone only on major move in days and if this is the case, there will be signage. Advise all to study the area where they park and look for signage regarding parking and whether or not it is sponsored by DePaul for the day. DePaul University is NOT responsible for any parking tickets received.
