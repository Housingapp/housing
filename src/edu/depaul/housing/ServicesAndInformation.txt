ACCESS ASSISTANCE (KEYS & LOCKS)

If residents are having trouble with their room keys and/or ID card hall access, they should visit their area office during move-in hours for assistance. After-hours assistance is available by visiting the front desk of the building or area and the front desk receptionist can contact a facilities assistant to assist.

For other ID, key and lock questions, refer to the Guide to Student Housing.

For tech support, visit the Genius Squad in the J.T. Richardson Library, room 115, 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. on August 27 and September 2. 

The Genius Squad help table has student staff members who are available to answer questions and offer services.
